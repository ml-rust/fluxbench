# Save benchmark baseline after merging to main.
#
# This workflow runs the same benchmarks as benchmark.yml but in "save" mode:
# it writes a baseline JSON to the GitHub Actions cache, keyed by commit SHA.
#
# benchmark.yml (on PRs) restores this cache to compare against, enabling
# regression detection. Cache keys use prefix matching so the latest baseline
# from main is always picked up, even across many merges.
#
# Also runs on workflow_dispatch for manual baseline refresh.
